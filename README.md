# Password-Generator

In This Project I created a password generater. I used the skills that I have learned from Javsscript. I created my variables then added alerts and prompts. I created most of my variables globally. I created a while loop as well. Finally I created my password generater to generate the password.

I will provide a link to for visability. As I built the project I made comments for better understanding.

This project was very challenging only because this is the first time using Javascript.
